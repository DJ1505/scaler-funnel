# Deploy in 2 minutes — GitHub Pages (easiest)

No server, no build, no config. Your repo is already on GitHub.

---

## 3 steps

### 1. Open your repo
Go to: **https://github.com/DJ1505/scaler-funnel**

### 2. Turn on GitHub Pages
- Click **Settings** (top menu of the repo)
- In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
- Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**: choose **Deploy from a branch**
- Under **Branch**: choose **main** and **/ (root)**
- Click **Save**

### 3. Wait ~1 minute
GitHub will build and publish. Your site will be at:

**https://dj1505.github.io/scaler-funnel/**

(If the repo name changes, the URL changes to `https://dj1505.github.io/<repo-name>/`.)

---

## Done

Open the URL and use **Check My Job Readiness**. Everything runs in the browser — no backend needed.

---

## Optional: custom domain

In the same **Pages** settings you can add a custom domain (e.g. `readiness.yoursite.com`).

---

## Alternative: Netlify

If you prefer Netlify: [Add new site](https://app.netlify.com/teams/dj1505/projects) → Import from Git → choose **DJ1505/scaler-funnel** → Deploy. The app works there too (with or without the serverless function; the in-browser analysis runs either way).
